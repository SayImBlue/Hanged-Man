# Hanged-Man
A simple hanged man game, here you are gonna find two versions, an older one (v1) and a revised one (v2), the revised one just splits the main into multiple functions without changing the logic much

WARNING ! In order to run the code you need to download the Words.txt file and change the file opening path for it (for example mine is Mac/Desktop/CTest/) You NEED to change the file path in order for it to work
